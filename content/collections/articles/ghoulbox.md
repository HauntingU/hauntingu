# Haunter's Ghoulbox

Here are some of the basic tools that you will find most useful as you begin to put on your home haunt.  For more detail, our Construction discussion (Episode 4) will provide more information and detail about tools and techniques.  As always if you have questions about the tools listed here, or other questions about construction, be sure to reach out to us.  We will add more information and tools as we continue to build the site.  Remember a good haunt does not have to be a complicated haunt.
