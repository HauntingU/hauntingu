Who doesn't love a pink dolphin?
 
John met Keoni in the sixth grade and after stealing a few of Keoni’s belongings they became 
instant friends. He joined Keoni’s haunting efforts the next Halloween and has been striking 
fear into the hearts of trick-or-treaters ever since. While an accomplished scaractor himself, 
John’s specialty lies in brainstorming, marketing and stage management. 
 
After many years spent in sales, John finally escaped into the world of telecommunications. 
John developed the storyline and helped design the layout for the Arkham Asylum Haunted House 
before bringing his marketing expertise to bear and ultimately tripling the visitor count between 
2014 and 2015. 
 
John is married to the incredibly patient and supportive, Heather, a teacher in the Littleton area.
