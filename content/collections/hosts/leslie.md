Leslie was the most reluctant member of the team who who was first introduced to Keoni&#39;s haunting
efforts when she spent a Halloween throwing water balloons at scareactors. She spent all of high
school running around in black clothing behind of the scenes of Under Milkwood, Guys and Dolls,
Annie Get Your Gun, Children of Eden, Fiddler on the Roof, Cinderella and countless one-act plays
and live performances.

After high school she attended Miami University (no, not the one you think, its in Ohio) followed by
the University of Colorado Boulder where she studied International Affairs, Chinese, History, Chinese
Language and Literature, and Chinese History. Her eclectic (and occasionally absurd) education helps
her create character backgrounds, storylines, and costumes for assorted haunts.

She joined Keoni's efforts in 2014 where she managed the costume and makeup design for Zombie
Apocalypse followed by the Arkham Asylum Haunted House bringing the famed comic character
Harley Quinn to life (which earned acclaims from Harleys creator Paul Dini). When shes not haunting,
she's trying to catch up on her movie/TV show watch list, running the finances for two Colorado
companies, and giggling maniacally.

Leslie is married to her indescribable husband, Alan, who somehow manages to put up with all of us.
