The real blood from Harley's hammer really added to the atmosphere.
 
Keoni started haunting when he was 12 years old by jumping out of the bushes in his parentâ€™s yard 
at unsuspecting trick-or-treaters. He continued building larger and larger haunts over the next 
several years until his haunting days were interrupted by college.
 
Keoni attended the US Coast Guard Academy and learned the finer aspects of set, audio, 
lighting design and stage management with CGA Productions where he worked on Oklahoma, 
Footloose, Bye Bye Birdie, Once Upon a Mattress, and I Hate Shakespeare in addition to numerous
live performances. Keoni learned how to incorporate theatrical special effects and design into his
haunts.
 
After college, Keoni continued to dabble in amateur theater by designing sets and stage managing 
for the Sunset Elementary School Drama club and their productions of The Little Mermaid Jr. and 
Seussical Jr. After moving back to Colorado, Keoni rounded up the old gang and developed two 
large home-haunts: The Zombie Apocalypse and his most recent attraction, the Arkham Asylum 
Haunted House, which is featured heavily in the Haunting U podcasts. 
 
Keoni is lucky enough to be married to the most understanding woman in 
the world, Ashley, and has two rambunctious toddlers Luka and Walker.
