Go listen to Episode 15 if you haven't already!  This is not really an episode.  In fact this is nothing but the pure, raw, uncut, unedited, unmitigated, unfiltered, unreasonable, uncooked, unorthodox, uncrocked, (I'm running out of un-words now) recording of our storyline brainstorming session where we created the storyline that made it into the pitch for Haunted Ship.  

We hope you enjoy listening to us shoot ideas around the table, and it inspires your own storyline creation.
